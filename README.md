## About Me

Frontend engineer with over 17 years of professional experience. I’ve worked in both high-tech startups and large corporations, successfully delivering products of various complexity. I’ve repeatedly launched products from scratch — from architectural design to release and long-term support. Experienced in managing teams of up to 8 people, including in distributed environments.

I strive to balance technical solutions with business goals, focusing on results and user value. Calm and responsible under pressure. I believe in leading by example as the best way to motivate a team.
