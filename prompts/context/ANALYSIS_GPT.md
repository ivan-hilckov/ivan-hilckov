## Overall Assessment

A strong senior profile with clear domain depth in geospatial and media streaming, proven impact, and leadership experience. The resume is concise, readable, and already includes quantified outcomes and working links. With minor ATS-oriented formatting normalization, expanded metrics for recent work, and a few phrasing refinements, it will be highly competitive for Lead Frontend/Full‑stack roles.

## Strengths

- **Impact and metrics**: Latency −40%, 800+ E2E tests, 100 GB resumable uploads, Gazprom competition result, team sizes.
- **Distinct domain expertise**: Geospatial (Cesium/Mapbox/Potree) and streaming (FFmpeg/HLS).
- **Skimmable structure**: Clear sections, concise bullets, action/outcome focus.
- **Delivery signals**: MVP in 3 months, CI/CD, i18n, A/B testing, documentation.
- **Links and portfolio**: Working repositories and demo link included.

## Weaknesses

- **ATS risks**: Non‑ASCII characters (en dashes, non‑breaking spaces, ±, m³) can hinder parsers.
- **Section naming**: "Experience (Selected)" deviates from common "Work Experience" heading.
- **Role targeting**: Header states "Lead Fullstack Engineer" but experience emphasizes frontend leadership.
- **Bot Garden metrics**: Lacks traction indicators (users, revenue, retention, infra scale).
- **Skills taxonomy**: Omits some tools noted in experience (e.g., Redux‑Saga, Selenium); minimal cloud/platform detail.

## Recommendations for Improvement

- **ATS formatting**
  - Use ASCII hyphens in dates and headings. Replace non‑breaking spaces and special symbols (± → "+/-", m³ → "m3").
  - Standardize heading to "Work Experience". Avoid HTML entities (e.g., `&nbsp;`).
- **Role positioning**
  - If targeting frontend leadership: change header to "Lead Frontend Engineer" or "Lead Frontend/Full‑stack Engineer".
  - Add one sentence in the summary about scope, leadership, and impact (performance, reliability, delivery).
- **Expand measurable outcomes**
  - **START**: add traffic scale (MAU/DAU), player metrics (startup time, rebuffering), A/B lift, conversion, LCP/CLS.
  - **Bot Garden**: add users/WAU/MAU, paid users, conversion, infra cost per user, time‑to‑ship.
- **Skills enhancements**
  - Include: Redux‑Saga, Selenium, Cypress/Jest split, GitHub Actions, Docker, i18n, A/B testing. If applicable, add cloud (AWS/GCP services) or state on‑prem/VPS.
  - Group by competency: Frontend, Backend, Datastores, QA/Testing, DevOps, Domains.
- **Keyword optimization (ATS)**
  - Ensure presence of: React (18), Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, Redux‑Saga, Node.js, Express/FastAPI/Flask, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Cypress, Jest, Selenium, E2E testing, A/B testing, i18n, WebGL, Mapbox GL JS, CesiumJS, Potree, FFmpeg, HLS/DASH, video streaming, resumable uploads (tus.io), performance optimization, caching.
- **Link consistency**
  - Keep PDF labels consistent ("CV.pdf", "CV_FULL.pdf"). Verify LinkedIn, GitHub, and video links.

## Example of Improved Phrasing

- **Profile/Summary**

  - Current: "Lead Fullstack Engineer with 17+ years..."
  - Improved: "Lead Frontend/Full‑stack Engineer with 17+ years building React/Next.js platforms in streaming and geospatial domains. Led teams up to 8 engineers and shipped product increments end‑to‑end with measurable results (−40% latency, +80% release stability), focusing on performance, reliability, and pragmatic architecture."

- **Section heading**

  - Replace "Experience (Selected)" with "Work Experience".

- **Bot Garden — Founder (_Jun 2025 — Present_)**

  - "Launched a suite of Telegram bots (echo, long‑context Q&A, English writing) on Node.js/TypeScript with a shared orchestration runtime and CI/CD via GitHub Actions. Integrated WATA.pro payments. Shipped MVP in X weeks; onboarded Y users with Z% 4‑week retention; reduced infra cost to $A/1k users."

- **START — Lead Frontend Engineer (_Jan 2023 — May 2024_)**

  - Current: "Reduced latency by ~40% during peak traffic..."
  - Improved: "Reduced API P95 latency ~40% at peak by optimizing query patterns and caching, improving player start time and page interactivity on high‑traffic TV sections. Shipped Next.js features (Movies on TV, TV Series), integrated player and channel storefront, and refactored payments to Redux for reliability and reuse; mentored a team of 4 engineers."

- **Skyeer — Lead Frontend Engineer (_Apr 2017 — Jan 2023_)**

  - Current: "Implemented resumable uploads up to 100 GB..."
  - Improved: "Built a web‑GIS platform (React, Redux‑Saga, Mapbox/Cesium/Potree), authored 50+ UI components, and delivered an MVP in 3 months; won Gazprom ‘Unmanned Biathlon’. Implemented resumable uploads up to 100 GB via tus.io, advanced measurement tools, 360° panoramas, and point cloud visualization; led QA automation to 800+ Selenium E2E tests, improving release stability ~80%."

- **Sovzond — Senior Frontend Engineer (_Jun 2013 — May 2015_)**

  - "Designed and delivered the Satellite Imagery Archive SPA (Backbone, Leaflet, Bootstrap) with polygon search, WMS overlays, and virtualized tables; implemented cart/account features and migrated legacy services to REST."

- **Skills**
  - Current: "Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Redux..."
  - Improved: "Frontend: React (18), Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, Redux‑Saga, WebGL; Backend: Node.js, FastAPI, Flask; Datastores: PostgreSQL, Redis; QA/Testing: Cypress, Jest, Selenium; DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD); Domains: Geospatial (CesiumJS, Mapbox GL JS, Potree), Media/Streaming (FFmpeg, HLS/DASH)."
